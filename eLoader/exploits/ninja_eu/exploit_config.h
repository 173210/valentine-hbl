//Where to load hbl.bin in Ram

// a correct address can be found in psplink, by typing:
// malloc 2 test l 204800
// (the value you want is head address, try h instead of lto get a different address if needed
// Ideally, it should be either smaller than 0x08900000 or higher then 0x09000000.
// If you don't have any address in these areas, you can use GAME_PRELOAD_FREEMEM, which can free some memory *before* you load HBL, and maybe free some useful ranges
#define HBL_LOAD_ADDR 0x09F8CC00

// To get the correct values for TH_ADDR_LIST, EV_ADDR_LIST, SEMA_ADDR_LIST, GAME_FREEMEM_ADDR,
// the best is to use freemem.rb in the tools folder.
// otherwise you can gather these values with psplink

// can be found with psplink (thlist)
