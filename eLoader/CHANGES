- This revision doesn't work!!!
--> Crash in sceSystemMemoryManager (???) when resolving homebrew imports
- Added sceKernelAllocPartitionMemory
- Now the loader allocates memory for HBL
- Now HBL allocates memory for the homebrew
- Removed hooks from sceKernelAllocPartitionMemory, sceKernelGetBlockHeadAddr and sceKernelGetMaxFreeMemSize
--> Now the homebrew can use the whole free memory :-)
- Fixed a bug in loader.c that was causing crashes
--> In search_game_stubs, stub_list wasn't completely zeroed
- Fixed "CANNOT FIND THREAD TO DELETE" bug (HBL now doesn't exit)
--> We still need a proper fix!

2010/03/31
- Added sceKernelReferEventFlagStatus
- Added sceKernelDeleteEventFlag
--> imports.config and loader are changed, so remember to use the new ones when testing!
- Added find_evflag (thread.c)
- Added event flags, remaining semaphores and UserSbrk address to memory.c
--> Now we have 0x1410400 free bytes (20 Megabytes) :-)

- Added code for stopping and unloading the game module, but it crashes on sceKernelStopModule

- Attempt at fixing misaligned relocations

2010/03/07
- Fixed issue with relocated EBOOT.PBP :)

2010/03/07
- fixed the return value of prx_load_program in elf.c.
--> prx loading now works. To try, add BUILD_PRX=1 to the hello/Makefile, and copy eboot.prx to eboot.elf on the root of the memstick
--> Still doesn't work from EBOOT, there's a problem with the offset, needs investigation

04/03/2010
- Added a new config file (file structure on config.h) to move there some game information
- Implemented a library for easy interfacing with config file
- Added code for loader to handle the config file, thus resolving HBL imports that exist on game
- Added code for HBL to handle the config file, thus estimating own imports that the loader couldn't resolve

Last changes:
- Added a loader that loads HBL on scratchpad instead of game region
- HBL loader now also copies stubs used by HBL to scratchpad
- Added a new data structure (tSceLibrary) and subsituted estimate_syscall() with a new implementation
