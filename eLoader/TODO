**************************
* HBL TODO (OR NOT) LIST *
**************************

- Make syscall estimation better:
	- How do we estimate user-mode jumps?
	
- Run PRX

- Copy all MoHH stubs instead of the used ones (simplify stuff, but more memory used)

- Using external configuration files (to make HBL port to other game exploits faster & easier)
	1) All constants relative to the game should be on config files
	2) HBL loader should use a config file for imports used by HBL
	
- Search for more libraries in user modules to be able to estimate more syscalls

- Change the searching for relocation sections from ".rel." to Â¿ES? value of 08

- Change the searching for stub table section from ".lib.stub" to ??

- Support for sceKernelLoadModule() and sceKernelLoadExec() (possible without kxploit?)

- Make a function that searches through memory for a valid .lib.stub section (not)

- Make NID Table dynamic instead of static

- Replace PSPSDK libc code with own

- Late linking (only link when import called)
