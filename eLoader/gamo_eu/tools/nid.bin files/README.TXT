MOD.BIN is a crafted module that will hold the NIDs and calls relocated from a few utilities (0x102, 0x401 and 0x402).

NID.BIN does all the work of loading the crafted module into memory and relocating the calls from the utilities to the crafted module.

The source code for NID.BIN is included but it is game-specific, so it won't be useful for other games.
