## What is HBL? ##

HBL is a project to build an easy to port user-mode homebrew loader for both the Sony PSP and the Sony PS Vita consoles (through the integrated PSP emulator).

## Why HBL? ##

To allow users with yet unhackable PSPs or a PS Vita to experience the fruitful PSP homebrew scene.

## How can I install this on PSP? ##

Go to the forums ;) http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=204

## How can I install this on PSV? ##

Follow this instructions: http://wololo.net/wagic/vhbl/

## Does this allow me to downgrade? ##

No, will never be (_by itself_).

## Does whis allow full HEN/CFW? ##

No, will never be (_by itself_).

## Does this allow kernel access? ##

No, will never be (_by itself_).

## Does this load ISO/CSO? ##

No, doubt will ever be (_by itself_).

## Does this allow me to use emulators? ##

Most emulators do actually work! ;)

## Then what homebrews do work? ##

We're having tests for this here: http://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=11 (PSP) and here: http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=10859 (PSV)

## How about PS1 games? ##

PS1 games use a different mechanism to load and we have no plan to work on this for now.

## Is this useful for a normal user? ##

Some users already enjoy it, but the work is not finished yet.

## What's the project current status? ##

It's still a BETA, but the developers are working on it ;) You can check the current issues: http://code.google.com/p/valentine-hbl/issues/list. Also check the HBL development subforum: http://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=4 for more information/help on developing.

## When this will be completed? ##

No timing schedule.

## When this will be useful for normal users? ##

It is already ;)

## What is need to be done to finish it? ##

See the ==What's the project current status?== question.

## Can I make modifications/use the source code for myself? ##

Yes you can, in fact it's your right. But you **MUST** (and this allows everyone to get this right as you did) also make the source with the changes you did available for everyone to download. You cannot distribute only the binaries.
